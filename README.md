Emotion Detection using Deep LearningThis repository explores various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to perform Facial Emotion Recognition (FER). The goal is to classify human facial expressions into discrete categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.📊 DatasetThe models are trained using the Emotion Detection FER dataset from Kaggle.Source: Kaggle Emotion Detection DatasetContent: Grayscale images of faces, categorized by emotion.🏗️ Models ImplementedI have implemented and compared three different deep learning approaches to evaluate their performance on the FER task:Custom CNN: A baseline architecture built from scratch using Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dropout layers.VGG16: A pre-trained model known for its simplicity and depth, fine-tuned for facial classification.ResNet50: A residual network that utilizes skip connections to train deeper architectures without vanishing gradient issues.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesEnsure you have the following installed:Python 3.xJupyter Notebook / Google ColabTensorFlow / KerasOpenCV, NumPy, and MatplotlibInstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/Khanghoang2804/Emotion-detection.git
